     <!-- The main reason we use git is for code sharing whether GitHub is used for hosting The repository -->
     <!-- Link tag is used for linking the media from another sources -->
     <!-- The space we create to publish a filein git that space which is empty is known as Repository -->
     <!-- The files which are to be published in GIT have three levels 
    1. Modified : Changes happens in a file which is not directed to your database yet. 
    2. Staging : marking the file which has been modified and ready to get published in git which also means getting committed
    3. Committed : Storing your data into the database safely
     git init command is probably the first command you will use to publish your file into the repository.g-->
